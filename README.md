# Unlock-mobile-screen-using-handwritten-graphics
## Introduction
This is my master's thesis project. It proposes a scheme of unlocking the mobile phone screen using handwritten graphics (signature), including a mobile app and several experiments (datasets and codes). I mainly used a DTW-based algorithm to verify online handwritten graphics. In the experimental part, I tried to use the machine learning classification algorithm to predict the forgery difficulty level.

## Folder
* Screenlock - the unlock scheme application on Android
* Experiments -  experimental code and dataset

## Install guide
All the codes can be run. You need Android Studio to compile the applicaion 'Screenlock'. For exeriments part, I use python3.7 and Jupyter Notebook. For more information, please send me an email: leven_developer@outlook.com
